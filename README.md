## Getting Started

#### Testing App
Apk's link was created with expo for android. Download Android [APK here](https://expo.io/artifacts/e625cf75-d3f4-448d-9330-82e4482e6886) and the iOS [Standalone App here](https://expo.io/artifacts/dfa2399d-5a8a-4222-b10f-ae92fda32b72)



After downloading the apk drag and drop it to an emulator or try to install it on your Android device.

In case you did not succeed with the APK, try to run in debug mode using the following instructions.

#### Installing the App
First of all you need to install machine dependencies.
Verify if you have expo-cli installed on your machine.
For that run:

```
npm install --global expo-cli 
```

or

```
yarn global add expo-cli 
```
After that inside Project's folder install all of the dependencies running:

```
yarn install
```
After that start project with
```
yarn start
```
To be able to run the project you just need to download the expo application at the Stores and scan the QrCode that will be available at the terminal.
Alternatively, if you have an Android Emulator installed on your machine just press 'a' on the terminal and the expo will install it on your emulator or app.
